# Audit Service Documentation

## 1. Description
The **Audit Service** is a microservice responsible for recording and storing audit logs generated by various services within a system. It ensures that all actions performed by users and services are logged securely and tamper-proof. The service leverages **Kafka** for event-driven message processing, **MongoDB** for scalable and flexible log storage, and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure authentication and authorization.
